  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  country TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

**Variable Date Holidays:**

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Population Script

Created `backend/populate-holidays.js` that:
- Connects to the SQLite database
- Clears existing holidays in the target date range
- Inserts 149 holidays (68 Canada + 76 Brazil)
- Provides detailed logging and error handling

#### 2. API Integration

Uses existing holiday API endpoints:
- `GET /api/holidays` - Retrieve all holidays
- `POST /api/holidays` - Add new holidays
- `PUT /api/holidays/:id` - Update holidays
- `DELETE /api/holidays/:id` - Delete holidays

#### 3. Frontend Integration

Holidays are managed through the existing Time Off Management interface:
- **Time Off tab** → **Add Holiday** function
- **Holiday Management** section
- **Country-specific filtering**
- **Date range selection**

### Usage Instructions

#### Running the Population Script

```bash
cd backend
node populate-holidays.js
```

#### Expected Output

```
Starting holiday population...
Cleared 0 existing holidays in the date range.

Holiday population completed!
✅ Successfully inserted: 149 holidays
❌ Errors: 0 holidays

Total holidays added:
🇨🇦 Canada: 68
🇧🇷 Brazil: 76

Date range: July 1, 2025 - December 31, 2030
Database connection closed.
```

#### Managing Holidays in the Application

1. **Access Time Off Management:**
   - Navigate to the Time Off tab
   - Select "Holidays" section

2. **Add New Holidays:**
   - Click "Add Holiday" button
   - Fill in holiday name, date, and country
   - Save the holiday

3. **View and Filter Holidays:**
   - Use country filter (Canada, Brazil, Both)
   - Search by holiday name
   - View calendar overview

4. **Edit/Delete Holidays:**
   - Click edit/delete icons on holiday entries
   - Confirm changes or deletions

### Data Verification

#### Database Queries

**Count holidays by country:**
```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM holidays 
WHERE date >= '2025-07-01' AND date <= '2030-12-31' 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY country;
```

**View sample holidays:**
```sql
SELECT name, date, country 
FROM holidays 
WHERE date >= '2025-07-01' AND date <= '2030-12-31' 
ORDER BY date, country 
LIMIT 20;
```

### Integration with Capacity Planning

Holidays are automatically treated as non-working days in:

1. **Employee Availability Calculations**
   - Working hours exclude holiday dates
   - Capacity planning considers holiday impact

2. **Project Scheduling**
   - Project timelines account for holidays
   - Resource allocation excludes holiday periods

3. **Time Off Management**
   - Holiday dates are marked as unavailable
   - Conflict detection with vacation requests

### Maintenance and Updates

#### Adding New Holidays

1. Edit `backend/populate-holidays.js`
2. Add new holiday entries to the `holidays` array
3. Run the script again (it will clear and re-populate)

#### Extending Date Range

1. Modify the date range in the script
2. Add holidays for additional years
3. Update the clear query date range

#### Adding New Countries

1. Add new country entries to the `holidays` array
2. Update the frontend country filter options
3. Add country flags to the `COUNTRY_FLAGS` mapping

### Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Database connection errors**
- **Duplicate holiday prevention**
- **Invalid date validation**
- **Country validation**
- **API error responses**

### Performance Considerations

- **Indexed queries** on date and country columns
- **Batch processing** for large holiday datasets
- **Efficient date range filtering**
- **Cached holiday data** in frontend context

## Summary

The holiday implementation successfully provides:

- **149 total holidays** across Canada and Brazil
- **Complete coverage** from July 2025 to December 2030
- **Seamless integration** with existing Time Off management
- **Automatic non-working day treatment** in all calculations
- **Comprehensive documentation** and maintenance procedures

The solution meets all specified requirements and provides a robust foundation for holiday management in the ResourceFlow application.
