- Verify backup file integrity before import
- Test imports on a development environment first

### üîÑ Migration Strategy

- Import to new system
- Verify all data transferred correctly
- Keep old backup as reference

## Troubleshooting

### Export Issues
- **Network Error**: Check server connection
- **File Download**: Check browser download settings
- **Large Files**: Ensure sufficient disk space

### Import Issues
- **Invalid File**: Ensure file is a valid ResourceFlow backup
- **Validation Errors**: Check error messages for specific issues
- **Import Fails**: Verify server is running and accessible

### Data Issues
- **Missing Data**: Check if all required fields are present
- **Corrupted Data**: Try importing from a different backup
- **Version Mismatch**: Update to latest version if needed

## Security Considerations

- Backup files contain all your data - keep them secure
- Don't share backup files with unauthorized users
- Consider encrypting backup files for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate backup storage locations
