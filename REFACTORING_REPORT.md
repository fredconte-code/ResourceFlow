# ResourceFlow Refactoring Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive refactoring of the ResourceFlow application to eliminate duplicated functions, establish a single source of truth for working hours calculations, fix data persistence issues, and implement comprehensive testing.

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicated Functions
- **Working hours calculations** were scattered across multiple components
- **Allocation percentage calculations** were duplicated in `EmployeeCard` and other components
- **Available hours calculations** used hardcoded values instead of Settings table
- **Time off calculations** were inconsistent across components

### 2. Inconsistent Data Sources
- Some components used API data, others used local data
- Hardcoded working hours values (150 for Canada, 176 for Brazil)
- Settings table not used as single source of truth
- Missing integration between holidays, vacations, and allocations

### 3. Data Persistence Issues
- Inconsistent database schema (camelCase vs snake_case)
- Missing foreign key constraints
- Import/export functionality had SQLITE_MISMATCH errors
- No referential integrity checks

## 🛠️ Refactoring Solutions

### 1. Single Source of Truth: Working Hours Module

**File Created:** `frontend/src/lib/working-hours.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `calculateAvailableHoursForEmployee()` - Main calculation function
- `calculateAllocatedHoursForEmployee()` - Project allocation calculations
- `calculateTimeOffDays()` - Holiday and vacation calculations
- `calculateAllocationPercentage()` - Utilization calculations
- `getWorkingHoursForCountry()` - Settings-based hour retrieval

**Benefits:**
- ✅ All calculations use Settings table as source of truth
- ✅ Consistent calculations across all components
- ✅ Support for different countries, holidays, vacations, and overtime
- ✅ Date range support for period-specific calculations

### 2. Updated Components to Use New Module

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/lib/employee-data.ts` - Removed hardcoded values
- `frontend/src/components/EmployeeCard.tsx` - Uses new calculation functions
- `frontend/src/components/PlannerView.tsx` - Integrated with working hours
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectAllocationChart.tsx` - Uses consistent calculations
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectDistributionChart.tsx` - Updated data sources

**Changes Made:**
- Removed hardcoded working hours (150/176)
- Integrated Settings table values (37.5/44 hours per week)
- Added buffer time calculations (20% default)
- Implemented proper time off calculations

### 3. Database Schema Consistency

**File Modified:** `backend/index.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Standardized all table schemas to use `snake_case`
- Updated all SQL queries to match schema
- Added proper foreign key relationships
- Fixed import/export data type mismatches
- Added error handling for import operations

**Tables Updated:**
- `team_members` - `allocated_hours`, `employee_id`
- `projects` - `start_date`, `end_date`, `allocated_hours`
- `vacations` - `employee_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- `project_allocations` - `employee_id`, `project_id`, `hours_per_day`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Team Management workflows
- ✅ Project Management workflows
- ✅ Calendar allocation workflows
- ✅ Time Off Management workflows
- ✅ Settings Management workflows
- ✅ Data Persistence workflows

**Workflow Tests:**
- Adding team members with validation
- Creating projects with color selection

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Working Hours Calculation Algorithm
```typescript
calculateAvailableHoursForEmployee(employee, context) {
  // 1. Get working hours from Settings table
  const weeklyHours = getWorkingHoursForCountry(employee.country, settings);
  
  // 2. Calculate total hours for period
  const totalHours = weeklyHours * periodWeeks;
  
  // 3. Apply buffer time
  const bufferHours = (totalHours * bufferPercentage) / 100;
  const availableHours = totalHours - bufferHours;
  
  // 4. Calculate allocated hours from projects
  const allocatedHours = calculateAllocatedHoursForEmployee(employee, allocations);
  
  // 5. Calculate time off days
  const { vacationDays, holidayDays } = calculateTimeOffDays(employee, holidays, vacations);
  
  // 6. Calculate utilization percentage
  const utilizationPercentage = (allocatedHours / availableHours) * 100;
  
  return { totalHours, allocatedHours, availableHours, bufferHours, vacationDays, holidayDays, utilizationPercentage };
}
```

### Database Schema Consistency
```sql
-- Before: Inconsistent naming
CREATE TABLE team_members (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  allocatedHours INTEGER  -- camelCase
);

-- After: Consistent snake_case
CREATE TABLE team_members (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  allocated_hours INTEGER  -- snake_case
);
```

### Test Structure
```typescript
// Unit tests for calculations
describe('Working Hours Calculations', () => {
  it('should calculate available hours with buffer', () => {
    const result = calculateAvailableHours(100, 20);
    expect(result).toBe(80);
  });
});

// Integration tests for API
describe('API Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should create, read, update, and delete team members', async () => {
    // Complete CRUD workflow test
  });
});

// E2E tests for workflows
describe('Planner E2E Workflows', () => {
  it('should add a new team member successfully', async () => {
    // Complete user workflow test
  });
});
```
